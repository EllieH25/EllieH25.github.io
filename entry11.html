<div id="entry">I finished the Migration Map! All eight of the flyways are coded, the birds are all moving around without glitches, and they all have information as well! I found some very useful pdfs from datazone.birdlife.org, one on each flyway, which supplied me with general information about each flyway as well as some birds that flew on it, which helped me choose which ones to display. This code was even longer than my recipe chooser (not much in terms of lines, but I have a lot of text, which takes up even more space than google doc links), which meant that it took a while, but I think it paid off! Iâ€™m really proud of how it turned out, and think it looks cool! </div>
