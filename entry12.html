<div id="entry">This week, I started a bird photo portfolio. I’ve been doing a lot of bird-related projects, and this one fits the bill as the next one to do! I figured out how to get all of the images I wanted onto the page, formatted well, using my Journal page as a template. Since I’m dealing with a lot of divs and images and so on and so forth, I’ve found that using “command+d” works well to quickly change something that is on all of the divs. The next step is to figure out how to make an image get larger when it’s clicked on, sort of like in the photos app. I could probably do it with opacity, like I did for the text in my last project, the migration map, but that would be very tedious, as I would have to define the opacity for all 21 images, not just 7. I am going to try to figure out another way to do it, (maybe using “class” or something) and will report back!</div>
