<div id="entry">It’s been almost a month since my last journal entry, so this one is just to catch up on what has happened since the last time I wrote. I finished the vaccine project, four pages long with animations, audio, and everything! I worked on it over spring break, but accidentally ‘broke’ my website right beforehand while trying to zip all the files from my website. I created a file that was too large, in my folder, so the computer couldn’t delete it and the file was stuck in the website’s history. Eventually we figured it out (it ended up being only one line of code) but it was stressful when I wasn’t able to push my website! All’s well that ends well though and now I’m looking forward to my next project, which is going to be about birds (again). I might do a few little projects along the way, but I have an idea for my final project, basically an online bird-id website that helps tell the difference between really similar-looking, common birds. I’m going to start with a Tufted Titmouse, Black-Capped Chickadee, and White-Breasted Nuthatch, and go from there. If you don’t know what those birds are, keep an eye out for this project! Hopefully it will help you recognize them and tell them apart!</div>

<div id="entry2">
Since I don’t have a lot of entries left (only one for each week until the end of the year), I’m going to put this with the previous entry and have weekly entries. In class on Friday, I started a karaoke project with Easha. We decided to use an array for the lyrics and to have the code point to one section and then the next. One issue was that the sections changed after 15 or 20 seconds, which made it difficult to have a single set interval. I realized this on the weekend and have been working on fixing it. I’m sure there are many other ways to do this, but I decided to do it the tedious way (since it was the way that I knew the best) and made the intervals smaller, so the code pointed to the next item every five seconds. I then copied the items in the array so they would show for 15 or 20 seconds, to roughly correspond to the lyrics. It’s not perfect, but it lines up pretty well.</div>
