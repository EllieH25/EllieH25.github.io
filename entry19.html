<div id="entry">It’s been almost a month since my last journal entry, so this one is just to catch up on what has happened since the last time I wrote. I finished the vaccine project, four pages long with animations, audio, and everything! I worked on it over spring break, but accidentally ‘broke’ my website right beforehand while trying to zip all the files from my website. I created a file that was too large, in my folder, so the computer couldn’t delete it and the file was stuck in the website’s history. Eventually we figured it out (it ended up being only one line of code) but it was stressful when I wasn’t able to push my website! All’s well that ends well though and now I’m looking forward to my next project, which is going to be about birds (again). I might do a few little projects along the way, but I have an idea for my final project, basically an online bird-id website that helps tell the difference between really similar-looking, common birds. I’m going to start with a Tufted Titmouse, Black-Capped Chickadee, and White-Breasted Nuthatch, and go from there. If you don’t know what those birds are, keep an eye out for this project! Hopefully it will help you recognize them and tell them apart!</div>
