<div id="entry">I presented my final project in class today. I think the presentation went well, but I’m sad that it’s over. I guess this is my last journal entry, and I’ve completed my goal of having exactly 28 entries. (I kind of forgot this month so there are four from this week alone, but that’s fine). Everything worked out! I got to make so many cool projects and it was really fun. Thanks again for everything Molly! </div>
