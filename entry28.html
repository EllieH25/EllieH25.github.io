My friend is doing a project on robins for bio, and since she knows I like birds, we were discussing her project together. We were looking at one article for research and read that robins sing at each other to show their dominance. She thought that robins singing at each other sort of like people yelling at each other was pretty funny, especially because she said she immediately thought of robins singing opera at each other (we had discussed opera earlier) rather than singing bird songs. It was a funny idea and inspired me to make this project: <a href="robin.html">https://ellieh25.github.io/robin.html</a></p></div>
<!-- for future entries, copy this div:
 <div id="entry_"></div>
fill in the number so it is one higher than the last entry, and then do css positioning (see commented out section above).
Put the text in a <p> tag separate from the date (see the first entry for reference)-->
