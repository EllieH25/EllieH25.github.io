This week, I’ve been working with arrays to create a bird generator. We’ve been working in JavaScript in class, and I wanted to create a bird generator using my photos. I learned how to make an array with different items and use it, although I ended up doing something different in the end. A few weeks ago, I made a circle sketch that generated circles randomly around the page with random colors, and I used a similar thing to make my bird generator. I uploaded 51 photos I’ve taken of birds and named them 0.jpg-50.jpg, respectively. I then used Math.random, with Math.floor, to choose a random number between 0 and 51, and then put that as the name of the jpg. Now I have a random generator of bird photos I’ve taken!
