<div id="entry">I wrote about my final project, but since I have three more journal entries, I’m going to talk about what I did over the weekend. I went to the World Series of Birding with my aunt! It was really fun to go, although it was rainy and for much of the day, you could only see about fifty feet in front of you. Despite the rain and fog, I managed to see 75 species of birds, more than I’ve ever seen in one day before, and I saw 25 new species! It was really cool and I’m so glad I got to go. If I can get my life together this week, I’ll organize my pictures and maybe make a quick project to show them. I would model it off of the bird portfolio project. Everything is about birds!</div>
