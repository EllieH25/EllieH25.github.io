<div id="entry">I finished making my website homepage! This week, I’ve mainly been working on my journal. I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but (as I did not realize at first) it included a lot of coding the same thing over and over again. I set up a bunch of pages for my journal entries, each with a bird of a slightly different color on it. I made 28. It was a lot. I had to code each one, changing a tiny bit to accommodate the entry number, but each time I made a change, I realized I had forgotten something and had to do it again. It took a while, but eventually, I got it. That was my big task this week, and I’m happy I accomplished it!</div>
