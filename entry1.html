In the past few weeks, I’ve been working on making my website. I wanted to do it bird-themed because I really like birds, and had a lot of ideas for how to do it, but it was much harder than I expected. I had a few gifs that I wanted to use, but they kept on not working, and I had to figure out how to code them so they would work. After I had all the images I wanted, I had to position them, which was a whole other challenge. Sometimes all that was wrong was an extra space somewhere, but sometimes it took a while to figure out how to troubleshoot my problems. Eventually though, I figured everything out, and now have a website I’m happy with! I’m excited to create the other pages on my website and to, eventually, make a fun bird-related project.
