<div id="entry">In biology, we’re studying mRNA and protein synthesis, and are doing a project on how mRNA vaccines work, specifically the COVID-19 vaccine. We’re supposed to represent it visually, using some form of recording (such as a dramatic reenactment, or stop-motion animation), and I decided to do something a little different and code my project. Since we need to have an audio aspect (and provide a transcript), I’m going to make it so that there’s a little animation, and a button that you click that will play a recording of audio about the animation. I will have to learn how to incorporate audio into a website using javascript, but it will be fun to figure out! So far, I have a page on how the mRNA gets into the cell, with an explanation. I still need to add the audio, but that will be the next step. </div>
