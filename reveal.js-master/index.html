				<section>COMPUTER SCIENCE FINAL PROJECT</section>
				<section>My whole life I've been birdwatching, but until the pandemic, I had never seen a warbler. Once I saw one, I started learning more about them and, although there are so many it is impossible to keep them straight, I enjoy seeing them. </section>
				<section>How much do you know about warblers?</section>
				<section>
					Warblers are small, about the size of a sparrow, and come in every color of the rainbow. <p>
					<a href="warblergenerator.html"><img src="warblers.png"></a></p>
				</section>
				<section>Warblers are very difficult to get photos of, because they are constantly flitting around in trees, but I was able to get a few okay photos. <p><a href="birdportfolio.html"><img src="portfolio.png"></a></p></section>
				<section>They are also migrating birds. About 35 warbler species travel along the Atlantic Flyway, and I have seen about 15 of them. 
					<p><a href="migration.html"><img src="./migration/migration.png"></a></p></section>
				<section>As seen in that animation, in the spring, most warblers start in South America, moving to the US to land to get food to continue on their journey to Canada. In the fall, they then return to South America from the north.</section>
				<section>I made this animation with keyframes, moving the warbler around with positioning. <p><img src="keyframes.png"></p> </section>
				<section>In addition to moving around, the warbler changes direction. There are many ways I could have done this, but I did it by having multiple background images. <p><img src="keyframes1.png"></p></section>
				<section>For the first project, I used javascript to make a function that changes the image when you click. <p><img src="warblercode.png"></p>I modeled it off a project which randomly generated a photo of a bird when you click.</section>
				<section>Projects like these have been fun ways for me to incoprorate my passion for birds into comp-sci projects. Since I took a lot of photos of birds throughout the pandemic, I used a lot of them in my projects, which was also fun. </section>
				<section>In making these projects, I was able to learn more about birds and I had a lot of fun incorporating my photos into these projects. 
				</section>
				<section>For example, I had never really understood flyways (the paths most birds migrate on) until I made my migration project (which I edited to show just a warbler).</section>
				<section>I learned a lot, even just making this presentation. I love all birds, specifically chickadees, even though I focused this presentation on warblers. </section>
				<section>In case you forgot, here's what I mentioned about warblers during my presentation:
					<p>- They are small songbirds about the size of a sparrow</p>
					<p>- They are very colorful in spring, but drab in the fall. </p>
					<p>- They are constantly flitting around in trees to get insects, which makes it difficult to photograph them.</p>
					<p>- They are migratory birds, and the ones I've seen travel along the Atlantic Flyway. </p>
				</section>
				<section>I hope you learned something new about warblers in my presentation. Thanks for listening! </section>
