<div id="entry">I haven’t been able to work on coding projects recently because of the musical, Pippin, but now I’m getting back into it. I’ve enjoyed working with JavaScript. It’s a little confusing, but I’m starting to get the hang of it. I’ve made a few random little projects with it, and want to incorporate it into something larger. I’m not sure what I want to do long term, but I think that in addition to a bird map, having a random bird generator would be fun. It would be tedious to put in all the birds, but I think it would be fun. I’ve mostly been doing little projects, but I can’t wait to get back to the bigger ones!
