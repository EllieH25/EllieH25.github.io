<div id="entry"> We just got back from winter break! I had initially intended to have 28 journal entries, but seeing as I’m halfway through the year and this is my 9th, I’m not sure I’ll make that goal. On a different note, I’m making a data representation project on bird migration. It’s sort of evolving as I’m making it, but I think it will be a series of bird animations moving around the page on flyways, and when you click on them, they will have specific details about the birds on that flyway. So far, I only have the flyways in the Americas, but I’m working on the others. It’s fun to make them fly around the page. I think that once I get all the animations I will use JavaScript to be able to click on a bird to see information about the flyway it's on!</div>
