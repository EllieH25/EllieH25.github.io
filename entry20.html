<div id="entry">In class on Friday, I started a karaoke project with Easha. We decided to use an array for the lyrics and to have the code point to one section and then the next. One issue was that the sections changed after 15 or 20 seconds, which made it difficult to have a single set interval. I realized this on the weekend and have been working on fixing it. I’m sure there are many other ways to do this, but I decided to do it the tedious way (since it was the way that I knew the best) and made the intervals smaller, so the code pointed to the next item every five seconds. I then copied the items in the array so they would show for 15 or 20 seconds, to roughly correspond to the lyrics. It’s not perfect, but it lines up pretty well.
