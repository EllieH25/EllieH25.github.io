<div id="entry"> Right before winter break, our class all made “How it Works” presentations, which are about how different kinds of tech work, and shared them. Since I love birds (as all my projects reflect), I did one about bird trackers and the basics of how they are used. Since there are many different kinds, I had a slide on each of the fundamental kinds as well as the basics to how they are used. It is not very long, but was fun to make since I’ve made a lot of google slides presentations.</div>
