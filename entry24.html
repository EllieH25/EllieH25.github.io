<div id="entry">Next week we are presenting our final presentations so I started mine this week. For an extra challenge, I decided to do it on reveal.js, using their template and then adding my own text and images. I’m focusing it on warblers and using that to highlight a few projects I’ve done as well as to hopefully be a little informative! It was cool using reveal.js and, although it took me a while to figure it out, I think my presentation is coming along! </div>
