<div id="entry">Ok, I have a newfound appreciation for JavaScript. Before it, I’ve been doing all my projects with one million (and one!) divs. For my Journal, there are 28 divs. For my recipe project, there are 40. Instead of having one code that covers all of them, I have individual divs with a class for general stuff and then individual code for positioning. That changed today! Molly showed me how to use JavaScript with a for loop to create as many divs as I want, in this case 30! Even though there are a lot of images, there is relatively little code! Using JavaScript, it’s also quite easy to add a click event listener that changes the background image of the large box to whichever small image you click on so you can see it in more detail! I’m thinking about adding a few flower photos, because I have a few really good flower photos in addition to my bird photos!</div>
