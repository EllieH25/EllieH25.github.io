<!-- Components:
1. JavaScript to randomly generate an image (can use bird generator code)
2.  An array that corresponds with the 50 photos of the names of the birds in the photos. 


Next Steps:

3. If able, code that also lists two names before and after the chosen one (in a random order) to click on to guess, then reveal correct (like that person's color game thing)

Figure out how to make it so that when you click once it chooses a number and displays the photo corresponding to that number, when you click again, it also displays the corresponding text from the array, but from the same variable. (Just ask Molly about counters)
