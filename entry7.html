<div id="entry">With all the breaks we’ve had, we’ve missed a lot of class, so I haven’t made anything in a while, but I’ve gotten back into it and made another project! I have a family friend who I do a lot of cooking with. We make recipes and then he types them up and usually gives them a funny name and blurb. We are going to see each other soon, and we are trying to figure out what we should make, but I’m indecisive, so I decided to make a codesketch that would choose for me. It was a little confusing, because I forgot how to use arrays, so I looked at what my classmates had done to get inspiration. After reading other people’s code, I had an idea of how to make my codesketch, and got started. It uses an array and code that points to elements in the array. I also wanted to put all of the recipes below it, which was very tedious. Since there are 40 recipes, I needed to make 40 divs, each with their own positioning and image, and I took much of the code from my journal page. It took a while though, because I had to put a google doc link to each of the 40 recipes separately. I made a mistake on the tenth (which I didn’t realize until I finished) and had to go back and put most of them in again. It was hard, but it paid off because I think it looks cool now!</div>
