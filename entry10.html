<div id="entry">Ok, so I know it’s only been a day, but I need to have more journal entries so here goes (I can always plop this one into the previous if need be). Anyways, I’ve been working on my migration project, as I said in my last entry, and today, I made the clicking bit! It is a simple javascript code that uses opacity and basically says “when this bird is clicked, make it have an opacity of 1 and make all the others have an opacity of 0.” Opacity is on a scale between 1 and 0, and I think it defines how see-through the item is, so if it is at 0, you can’t see it and if it is at 1, you can. I haven’t yet added the information about it, because I’m still working on the flyways. In addition to the javascript bit, I also made the animation for the bird that goes on East Atlantic Flyway. I think this one is the hardest because it is long and has a lot of turns. Also, for each major direction change, the bird changes direction, which is a whole other process (although I do it with images not code). 4 flyways down, 4 to go! </div>
