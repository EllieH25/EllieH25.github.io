<div id="entry">I realize that I haven’t made an entry for a while. Almost two whole weeks! And I’ve been busy in the Comp-Sci department these past two weeks. I’ve been applying to a birding program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology called the Young Birder’s Event. Since I’ve made a few bird-related projects in my comp-sci class, I decided to put together a new webpage with my best bird projects to submit as part of my application. It was fun to make the new page, although it involved copying the old projects into new ones so they would all be separate from my school website. In addition, I added one new bird project, and although it was on photoshop, I think it's still worthy of being on my website. I made it a few weeks ago and  put it on one page along with some information about it. It is sort of a bird ID card which I think looks pretty cool. I also added a Google Analytics thing to my new webpage so I could see how many people visit it, but I’m not entirely sure how it works. That’s my next little project – figure out how google analytics works. 

<p>For the future, we’re starting to brainstorm for our culminating project, but I don’t know what to do! I was thinking about maybe returning to the bird map idea but I’m not sure how I would do it that would be different from last time. I know I want to do a bird project, and it will be fun to figure out what that will look like! </p>
