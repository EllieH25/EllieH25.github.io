<h3>Info</h3>
This is something I put together on Photoshop, which is a medium I learned about last year. It's a compilation of the common birds from my photos into a bird ID card. For this project, I removed the backgrounds from a bunch of my photos and put them on here as a collage of birds. It ended up being like a bird ID card. It was hard to remove all the backgrounds, but it was fun to position them once I had them, and to watch the assortment of birds evolve on the page!</div>
