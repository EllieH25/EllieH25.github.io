<div id="entry">My friend Marcus is sick and many of my friends and I miss him, so I coded him a card. I got a few of my friends to give me quotes to put on the page and when you click, the quotes show one at a time, which was a good reinforcement of what I had learned with JavaScript. It was a little difficult to get the clicking for the quotes figured out, but eventually I figured it out, looking back at my Bird ID game and Migration Map for help with the code. Basically, it uses a variable that counts how many times the screen has been clicked, and if then statements that, based on the number of times youâ€™ve clicked, set the opacity of the quote divs. It shows all 8 quotes in order, then shows all of them, then none of them, then resets the counter.
<p>Here's a link to the card: <a href="marcus.html">https://ellieh25.github.io/marcus.html</a></p></div>
